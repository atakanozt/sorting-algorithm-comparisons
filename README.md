# Sorting Algorithms Performance Comparison

This project includes a C program that implements and times several common sorting algorithms, as well as a Python program that visualizes these times in a bar chart. Also, you can examine the sorting algorithms that are written in C.

The sorting algorithms implemented are:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort 3

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- C compiler (like `gcc`)
- Python 3
- Python libraries: `matplotlib`, `tkinter`, and `subprocess` 

You can install the Python libraries using pip:
```
pip install matplotlib tkinter
```


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/atakanozt/sorting-algorithms-comparison.git
</code></pre>


2. Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd sorting-algorithms-comparison
```


3. Compile the C program:
```
make
```

4. Run the Python program:
```
python3 visualize.py
```


5. The Python program will open a GUI where you can enter the size of the array to sort. Click "Run" to run the sorting algorithms and see a bar chart of the time each one took.
